     <ul>
            <li>The NewMobileDetails class provides a placeholder for displaying details of a new mobile product.</li>
            <li>The __init__ method contains a pass statement, indicating that it is a placeholder for future initialization.</li>
            <li>The display_details method prints "Details: Coming Soon", indicating that actual details are not yet available.</li>
        </ul>
     <ul>
            <li><strong>Placeholder Initialization:</strong> The <code>__init__</code> method of the <code>NewMobileDetails</code> class contains only a <code>pass</code> statement, indicating that there's no specific initialization logic implemented at the moment. This serves as a placeholder for future initialization steps.</li>
            <li><strong>Future Initialization:</strong> By using a <code>pass</code> statement, we reserve space for any future initialization logic that may be added later. This allows us to create the class structure without implementing specific initialization details immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Display Placeholder Details:</strong> The <code>display_details</code> method is responsible for displaying details of the new mobile product to users. Since actual details are not available yet, the method simply prints a message indicating that the details are "Coming Soon".</li>
            <li><strong>Placeholder for Future Updates:</strong> This class and its methods provide a way to interact with users or display information about the new mobile product even when the actual details are not yet finalized. It serves as a placeholder to inform users that more information will be available in the future.</li>
        </ul>
    <p class="summary">In summary, the NewMobileDetails class with the pass statement and the display_details method serves as a placeholder to display information about a new mobile product before the actual details are known. It prepares the structure for future updates and ensures that users are informed about the upcoming product, even if specific details are not available immediately.</p>
